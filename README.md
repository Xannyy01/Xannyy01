👋 Hi there! I’m Lovepreet — a tech enthusiast with a passion for backend magic and full-stack creation.

🚀 Currently leveling up my skills in the MERN stack and diving deep into Java & DSA for high-impact development.

🎯 My mission: Build efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications that make a difference.

💼 Future goals: Master DevOps, explore cloud deployment, and refine full-stack expertise.

💡 Fun fact: I started out in BA but pivoted to BTech in CSE the second I found my love for code.
